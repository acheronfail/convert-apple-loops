# `convert-apple-loops`

A simple script that converts the Apple Loops from Garageband from `caf` into `aiff` so other programs (like Ableton) can use them.

### Requirements

* macOS
* Garageband installed, with the loops downloaded
* [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (can be installed via `brew install fd`)
* About ~30GB of free disk space

### Usage

```bash
# Clone this repository.
git clone git@github.com:acheronfail/convert-apple-loops.git
cd convert-apple-loops

# Run the script!
bash convert-apple-loops.sh
```
